## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- JavaFX

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

3. Set up the JavaFX SDK in your IDE to enable JavaFX support. Refer to your IDE's documentation for instructions.

4. Build and run the project.

5. The Library System GUI will open, showcasing its sleek design and intuitive user interface, allowing you to interact with the library effortlessly.

## Usage

- Upon launching the Library System, you will be greeted with a visually stunning GUI featuring input fields and buttons with smooth animations.

- To add a book, simply enter the book name and select the category from the visually appealing dropdown menu. Click the "Add Book" button, and the book will be seamlessly added to the library.

- To remove a book, click the "Remove Book" button. A stylish dialog will prompt you to enter the book's ID. If the book is not currently borrowed, it will be effortlessly removed from the library.

- To borrow a book, click the "Borrow Book" button. Enter the book's ID and specify the borrowing period in days using the sleek input fields. If the book is available, it will be borrowed for the specified period, providing you with a seamless borrowing experience.

- To return a book, click the "Return Book" button. Enter the book's ID, and the Library System will handle the smooth dialog, ensuring that the book is promptly returned to the library.

- To view the library's status, click the "View Library" button. The Library System will display a visually appealing table showcasing the list of books, their categories, borrowing status, borrowing period, and borrowing date. Additionally, it will provide you with valuable statistics such as the number of books in each category and the total number of borrowed books.

## Limitations

- The capacity of the library is set to 100 books. Once the library reaches its capacity, no more books can be added. However, the sleek design ensures that the available space is well-utilized.

- Book IDs are generated automatically and cannot be modified. Each book is assigned a unique ID upon creation, ensuring efficient book management.

- The Library System GUI does not provide search functionality or advanced filtering options for book retrieval. However, the intuitive design and smooth navigation make it easy to find and interact with books using their IDs.
